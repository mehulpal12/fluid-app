# Class 10 Fluids â€“ Interactive Module

## Documentation: Approach and Design Decisions

### Approach

The goal of this project was to make learning the topic of **Fluids** for Class 10 more engaging by combining theory with hands-on visual exploration. Traditional textbooks often struggle to make abstract concepts like buoyancy, pressure, and Archimedesâ€™ principle intuitive. Hence, we designed an **interactive educational module** with simulations, animations, and interactive controls.

Key steps in our approach:

1. **Content Breakdown** â€“ We identified the most important subtopics: fluid pressure, buoyant force, density, and Archimedesâ€™ principle.
2. **Visual Representation** â€“ Each concept was supported with clear animations and simulations (e.g., showing how pressure changes with depth).
3. **Interactivity** â€“ Sliders and buttons were included so students could experiment with variables like volume, density, and depth.
4. **Feedback Loop** â€“ Real-time updates show outcomes instantly, making the learning experience more engaging.
5. **Accessibility** â€“ Designed with responsive layouts and a clean interface so it works on desktop and mobile devices.

### Design Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**

   * **React + Tailwind CSS**: For building a responsive and interactive front-end quickly.
   

2. **UI/UX Considerations**

   * Minimalistic design with focus on visuals over text.
   * Labels and helper text to explain each control clearly.

3. **Pedagogical Choices**

   * Encourage self-learning by letting students experiment rather than passively read.
   * Provide instant feedback through numeric values and animated changes.


### Learning Outcomes

* Students gain a **visual understanding** of fluid concepts.
* Enhanced **engagement and curiosity** compared to static textbook diagrams.
* Improved **problem-solving ability** through interactive experiments.
